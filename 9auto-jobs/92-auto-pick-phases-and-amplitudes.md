SEISAN has 3 programs for auto picking phases: AUTOPICK, AUTOSIG and AUTOPHASE. AUTOPICK can pick P and S phases and coda length, AUTOSIG can pick P-phases, amplitudes and do spectra and AUTOPHASE can pick P and S-phases and coda length. AUTOMAG can pick amplitudes and make spectra and is a simplified version of AUTOSIG.
