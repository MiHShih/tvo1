The AUTOPHASE program only operates from EEV so it can only be used with a single event. It is very easy to use since it does not require any parameter file. This has the disadvantage that all stations available in the waveform data will be used, however in many cases this is desired. AUTOPHASE pick both P and S and will also pick polarity on clear P’s.

* Select event 19960705, same as used for AUTOPICK.

* Delete already picked phases using the editor or the EEV command dels, make sure to keep all header lines.

* Give command ‘ap’ and phases should be picked and saved in S-file. There is no need to delete old phases since they are all deleted automatically.

* Plot event and inspect automatic picks, note that all picks are marked as I for impulsive. Also note that for some phases, polarity is picked.

* Locate event
