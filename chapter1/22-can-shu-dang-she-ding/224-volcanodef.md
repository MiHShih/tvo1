The VOLCANO.DEF file \(p227\) is a numbered list of volcano-seismic event types. The number of volcano sub-classes is limited to 10. VOLCANO.DEF can be modified as needed for a particular observatory, volcano and eruption.



Here is a version for Mt. St. Helens.

As a general principal, for event subclasses to be useful in the long run, they should be descriptive of the waveform, rather than assigned general terms like LP and A- and B-type.
