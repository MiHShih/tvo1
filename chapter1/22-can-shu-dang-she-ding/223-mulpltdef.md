MULPLT.DEF \(p107\) lists parameters used in the MULPLT program. Note that the parameters must be aligned with the ‘Par 1’ and ‘Par 2’ markers since the file is read by Fortran, which reads a fixed format statement. None of these parameters need to be modified, although it is usually convenient to modify some of the ‘FILTER X’ settings to frequencies useful in band-passing data for spectral analysis, particle motion and magnitude determination. There are some suggested filter settings in the MULPLT.DEF example listed below.

Normally it is not useful to list ‘DEFAULT CHANNELS’. One exception is when the continuous database contains traces from many volcanoes but the events database is specific to one volcano. In that case, it is convenient to only list as DEFAULT CHANNELS those traces that would be useful to the event files for that volcano. In the example below, only RIN, SOP and EMP are listed as DEFAULT CHANNEL. All the other 13 traces in the continuous waveform file are left out of the displayed data. Another case is if a trace is dead, and therefore does not need to be included in an event waveform file. If no DEFAULT CHANNELS are listed, MULPLT.DEF lists all the channels in the waveform files.
