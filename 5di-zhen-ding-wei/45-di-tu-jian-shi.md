Here the stations are shown as red triangles and the event location is a small ‘+’. The event is a hybrid that should have located under the Mt. St. Helens dome at the center of the cluster of stations. The calculated location is poor, as might be expected from a single station STD, an emergent p-arrival, and no s-arrival. This example is not intended to show a good location, only that HYP can obtain a location solution from very sparse, poor data.

A better location could be obtained from more stations, using the same techniques shown above for determining phase arrivals, and azimuths.
