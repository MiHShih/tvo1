The precise location of volcanic events is usually difficult, given the emergent phase arrivals of many of the events, the complex velocity structure and the topography. In addition, most volcanoes have too few seismic stations for good locations.



However, in the experience of VDAP seismologists, precise event locations have not been shown to be of much monitoring value. VT events do not tend to reflect the actual location of the magma as much as the zone of weakness where stress from the deformation of an intrusion is being released, such as along nearby faults. Other events like shallow hybrids associated with dome growth may demonstrate some shoaling, but not early enough in the extrusive process to provide prognostic value. Shallow LPs are too emergent to locate well and generally just indicate groundwater boiling. Most volcanic events just locate under the volcano anyway.

Therefore we in VDAP focus our seismic monitoring effort less on the precise locations of events than on the temporal evolution of different types of seismicity and energy release. The locations are of interest only broadly; it is of value to know if they are located either under the vent area or off to the side of the edifice. If they are located off to one side, if they form distinct families of swarms.

The location technique outlined here is sufficient to broadly locate events, to a degree of precision sufficient for VDAP seismic-monitoring techniques.
