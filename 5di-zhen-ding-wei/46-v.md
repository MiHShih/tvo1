# Rejecting outliers

When locating earthquakes, one or two outliers can completely destroy the solution. Large outliers are often present when picking phases automatically. One way of dealing with this is to use residual weighting \(see HYP manual\). Another similar way is to search for phases with large residuals and weight out these. This has been implemented in EEV with command ‘lr’
