To un-zoom or re-plot the top trace again, pres ‘Plot’ or ‘r’ on keyboard.  
 The second method is to zoom on the top trace only. The first zoom click is inside frame with

the plot and the second is outside:

Phases can be read on all plots in single-trace mode, however if a lower plot is shown, readings can only be done there. On the top trace several zooms can be done until the desired resolution is obtained.
