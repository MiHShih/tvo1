# Wadati diagram

在 eev 環境中，輸入 'wad' 產生  Wadati diagram。

Wadati diagram 顯示S-和P-arrival 的到時時間差與P波到時之間的關係。

This is a program to make Wadati diagrams and apparent velocity from a Nordic file with one or many events. The apparent velocity is calculated from the arrival times and the calculated epicentral distances as given in the S-file. The apparent velocity is thus approximate and affected by the location.  
 The purpose of the program is to calculate Vp/Vs values for individual events and calculate the average for a group of events. In addition, the program can calculate the apparent velocity for each event based on P or S-times. Wadati diagrams with plot can also be calculated directly from EEV.
