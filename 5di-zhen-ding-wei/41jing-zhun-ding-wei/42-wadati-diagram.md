# Wadati diagram

Wadati diagram showing the difference between S and P wave traveltimes versus P wave traveltime.

This is a program to make Wadati diagrams and apparent velocity from a Nordic file with one or many events. The apparent velocity is calculated from the arrival times and the calculated epicentral distances as given in the S-file. The apparent velocity is thus approximate and affected by the location.  
 The purpose of the program is to calculate Vp/Vs values for individual events and calculate the average for a group of events. In addition, the program can calculate the apparent velocity for each event based on P or S-times. Wadati diagrams with plot can also be calculated directly from EEV.
