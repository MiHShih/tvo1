From the multi-trace mode, press ‘Togl’ \(or ‘t’\) on the menu and a single trace window comes up.

This window has different options in the menu as compared to the multi-trace window and is meant to be used for operations taking place with a single trace. The phases defined on the keyboard are shown \(all also defined in multi-trace mode\). Some magnitude operations are also indicated, see 8. To go back to multi-travel mode, press Togl again.
