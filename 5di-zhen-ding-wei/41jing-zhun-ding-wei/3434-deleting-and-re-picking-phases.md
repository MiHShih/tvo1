# Deleting and re-picking phases

A phase can be re-picked without deleting the old pick, the old phase will automatically be deleted when the same phase is re-picked on the same channel, see P-phase below. A phase can also be deleted by putting the cursor near the phase and pressing ‘d’ on keyboard as illustrated with the S-phase below.
