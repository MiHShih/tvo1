Using different models

SEISAN can use individual models for each event as indicated in the S-file in column 21 in the header line. Normally this field is blank indicating that the STATION0.HYP file is used. However, using e.g. the character x, file STATIONx.HYP will be used \(note that on Linux, upper and lower case is different but not on Windows\). It is also possible to locate local events with the global model.
