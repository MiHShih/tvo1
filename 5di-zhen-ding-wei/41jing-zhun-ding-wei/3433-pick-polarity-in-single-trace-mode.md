# Pick polarity in single trace mode

Polarity can be picked at the same time as a phase is picked. Polarity can be picked in multi- trace and single-trace mode but is simplest in single trace mode. Below is a zoomed signal in single-trace mode so the polarity is clearly seen. For the polarity to be picked, the cursor must be above or below the “Limits for polarity” marker. Put cursor as indicated below, press ‘1’ and the result is as shown. If there is a reading from before without polarity, just repick the same phase.
