# 波相到時選取\(II\) - single trace mode

Picking phases with using multi-trace screen is often not very accurate since it is difficult to zoom on several traces at the same time. So phases are mostly picked in single trace mode or three-component mode \(see 5.5\), where it is also easy to pick S on horizontal components. The other option is to use scrolling with the arrow keys to continue to use multi trace mode, see 5.3. In all cases, it might also be an advantage to amplify the amplitude with the vertical arrows, see 5.2.
