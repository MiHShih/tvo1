# Particle motion

使用 particle motion 幫助確認 coda length。方位角確定之後，可以從 otated components 的確定質點運動。  
從多 channel 模式：

1. 1\) Select the ‘Rotat’ button, followed by the ‘plot’ button to refresh the screen and show the rotated traces. The trace windows will now show the back azimuth, labeled, for example, ‘baz 148’ for a back azimuth of 148.

2. 2\) select the three components of a 3-comp sensor and select the ‘plot’ button

3. 3\) select the ‘PartM’ button.

Particle motion plots now appear under the three traces. Window the traces for the portion of the waveforms for which you want to view the particle motion. For a more detailed example, see Appendix 3.

Figure: screenshot of MULPLT single-trace mode particle analysis results. Note that the whole window is used for the particle motion, so the result here is unreadable. In general, select a short time window to view particle motion. Filtering is often required to bring the particle motion trace onto scale and into the box.
