Use the technique below for particle motion to help determine phase arrivals within the event coda.

After the azimuth has been determined \(as per the instructions on ‘event location with one 3-comp station’\), particle motion can be determined from the rotated components.  
 From the multi-trace mode:

1. 1\) Select the ‘Rotat’ button, followed by the ‘plot’ button to refresh the screen and show the rotated traces. The trace windows will now show the back azimuth, labeled, for example, ‘baz 148’ for a back azimuth of 148.

2. 2\) select the three components of a 3-comp sensor and select the ‘plot’ button

3. 3\) select the ‘PartM’ button.

Particle motion plots now appear under the three traces. Window the traces for the portion of the waveforms for which you want to view the particle motion. For a more detailed example, see Appendix 3.

Figure: screenshot of MULPLT single-trace mode particle analysis results. Note that the whole window is used for the particle motion, so the result here is unreadable. In general, select a short time window to view particle motion. Filtering is often required to bring the particle motion trace onto scale and into the box.
