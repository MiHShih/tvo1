就 SEISAN 啊！



These notes are intended to augment the SEISAN tutorial and manual with techniques specific to processing continuous files of volcano seismic data derived from an Earthworm continuous record module.

Broadly, that process is to

  
 1\) create and regularly add data from Earthworm continuous waveform files to a SEISAN database of continuous data  
 2\) Scroll through those data, identifying events, characterizing them by volcanic seismic event type by their appearance and registering them into an event database as event files \(SEISAN S-files\).  
 3\) Processing events in that event database to determine phase arrivals, azimuths, spectral characteristics, particle motion, and amplitudes of ground motion to determine locations, magnitudes, and energy release.  
 4\) Catalog time-series of numbers and energy-release of different types of volcano seismic event type.

In this manual steps 1 and 2 are organized under the section Routine Processing 1: registration. Steps 3 and 4 are organized under the section Routine Processing 2: EEV.
