# Local Magnitude

The local magnitude is picked on a trace simulating the Wood-Anderson seismograph. Select station HYA in single trace mode. Pressing WA in menu and then selecting a window and the corrected trace \(amplitudes in nm ground motion\) will come up:

The amplitude is then picked manually by moving the cursor to one extreme, press ‘a’ on keyboard, move to the opposite extreme, press ‘a’ on keyboard. The amplitude and period is then printed on the bottom of the plot and the phase IAML is indicated on the plot. The phase has an indication on the bottom \(a hat\) indicating that this phase has an amplitude associated. The max amplitude can also be measured automatically by only pressing ‘A’ with the cursor anywhere on the plot. If using automatic picking, check carefully that the automatic determination seems reasonable \(automatic pick will be plotted\).
